First project within The Odin Project journey. This will hopefully help me recall my html and CSS skills and demonstrate some newly learned content. Read more about how it went below.

This is not what I was expecting at all

With a 10 year old diploma in computer programming that included webt development courses, I thought I'd know and rememeber a lot more than I did. It seems the technology has changed a lot since I last worked with it. 

I enjoyed the opportunity to play with grid and flexbox and get my hands dirty with it. While the exercises were informative, they really did hold my hand and I wasn't sure I understood the concepts until I was required to put them into practice, and I'm glad I did. 

While this might not be the neatest replica of the Google search page, I'm satisfied thus far.
